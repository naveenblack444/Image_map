    <p style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: larger;">Tanjai Periya Kovil, also known as the Brihadeeswarar Temple, is one of the most iconic and grandiose architectural marvels of ancient South India, located in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu. This magnificent temple was built by the great Chola king Raja Raja Chola I in the early 11th century, around 1010 AD, and stands as a testament to the architectural brilliance and cultural grandeur of the Chola dynasty.</p>
    <p style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: larger;">The Brihadeeswarar Temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, and it is one of the largest temples in India. It is an outstanding example of Dravidian architecture, with intricate sculptures, expansive courtyards, and towering gopurams (gateway towers). The temple's main sanctum houses a massive Shiva lingam, symbolizing the deity, and the vimana (tower) over the sanctum rises to about 66 meters, making it one of the tallest of its kind in India.</p>
    <p style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: larger;">The temple's artwork and carvings depict various mythological stories and scenes from Hindu scriptures, showcasing the creativity and craftsmanship of the artisans of the time. The structure is made of granite, which was transported from nearby quarries, highlighting the Chola dynasty's engineering prowess.</p>
    <p style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: larger;">A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Brihadeeswarar Temple continues to draw pilgrims, historians, and tourists, not only for its spiritual significance but also as a symbol of the rich cultural legacy of the Chola Empire.</p>
